# Mental-Health-therapy-management-system

## About the project:
As the world progresses, depression, anxiety, rates of substance use disorders and feelings of isolation or
abandonment also multiplies. Mental health has a huge impact on how people relate to others, make decisions,
and handle stress. People’s ability to live fulfilling lives often depends on their mental health. Therefore,
prioritizing mental health is, of course, critical.

According to the Our World in Data, 2018, this study estimates that 970 million people have a mental health or
substance abuse disorder. JAMA Psychiatry, 2015 estimates that, mental disorders are attributable to 14.3% of
deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million deaths each year.

Mental health management database system is a platform that provides behavioral health care and helps patients
find resources available in their community. It provides patients with a questionnaire that they can take to
identify any mental health problems that they might have. Based on the score obtained from taking the
questionnaire, the system suggests a list of therapists and allows the patients to book an appointment with them.
Some other functionalities for patients include cancelling the appointment, view their appointment details,
check recommended treatment, book, or cancel an appointment with a rehab (on doctor’s recommendation), and
view their questionnaire score. The system also allows the therapists to create diagnosis and treatment for the
patients, view patient history, check existing schedules or add a new one. In addition to patients and therapists,
there is an admin who can view high-level information such as check the number of therapists in a particular
domain of illness, check the number of patients under a therapist, check the most common illness, check the
number of patients under a rehab, and return the most popular therapist. With this project, we want to help
people find the help that they need to maintain their mental health on a single platform.
